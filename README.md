If your work includes cadCAD modeling of token economies, protocols or web3 platforms feel free to submit a pull request for inclusion in the repo list found in https://github.com/TokenEngineeringCommunity/AraCred/blob/master/config/project.json. We'll review the repo and approve the pull request if its found to be a good fit for this community.

# TE Commons DAO

The DAO that AraCred is currently minting tokens for is the [TE Commons DAO](https://mainnet.aragon.org/#/tecommons/). AraCred is set to mint once per week, which at the time of writing is the default miniting period for SourceCred periods. This way we only mint tokens for the cred earned that weeek vs minting tokens for the total cred each time.  

# AraCred Deployment

Please see the [AraCred Deployment page](https://aracred.github.io/website/docs/deploymentOverview/) for info on how to setup and run AraCred.
